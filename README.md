Zero-install interactive physics simulations that run directly in your browser using **Google Colab + ipywidgets**.

Perfect for students learning signal processing, control systems, vibrations, or orbital mechanics — or just anyone who wants to *feel* engineering concepts instead of just reading them.

## Projects Included

### 1. RC Low-Pass Filter (Electrical / Signal Processing)
Interactive Bode plot + step response  
→ Instantly see how R and C change cutoff frequency and time constant  
[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/python-engineering-projects/blob/main/01_RC_Low_Pass_Filter/RC_Filter_Interactive.ipynb)

### 2. Spring-Mass-Damper System (Mechanical / Vibrations)
Watch underdamped → critically damped → overdamped behavior in real time  
The best way to truly understand second-order systems (car suspension, buildings, headphones…)

### 3. Two-Body Orbital Mechanics (Aerospace)
Launch satellites from LEO to geostationary to highly elliptical Molniya orbits  
See what happens when you get the velocity wrong (spoiler: you crash into Earth)

## How to Run (30 seconds)
Just click any of the **"Open in Colab"** badges above → everything runs in the cloud, no installation needed.

## Why This Repo Exists
Because textbooks show static graphs, but **real understanding comes from playing with parameters live**.

These notebooks were built to be:
- 100% interactive
- Visually beautiful
- Educational (every important concept is labeled)
- Ready to be forked and extended

Feel free to use them for teaching, learning, or as a starting point for your own projects!
